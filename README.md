# Chatbot-System-Intelligent-Assistant

This system is an AI-powered chatbot that supports Arabic language processing, capable of interacting via text and voice through a modern and interactive web interface.

Objective

To build an intelligent assistant capable of:
 • Understanding user inquiries in Arabic.
 • Responding with natural human-like voice using Text-to-Speech (TTS).
 • Receiving voice commands and converting them to text using Speech-to-Text (STT).
 • Providing a smooth and interactive communication experience through a web-based UI.

Key Features
 • Interactive Web Interface
A modern, user-friendly design that supports both text and voice input and displays real-time conversations.
 • Speech-to-Text (STT)
Voice input is processed and converted to text using the RealtimeSTT_Server.py script.
 • Arabic Language Processing (NLP)
Utilizes Cohere’s command-r7b-arabic-02-2025 model to understand Arabic queries and generate responses.
 • Text-to-Speech (TTS)
Uses ElevenLabs to produce natural-sounding human voice responses.
 • Real-Time Communication (WebSocket)
Ensures fast and seamless interaction between the user and the system.

How It Works
 1. The user sends a message (text or voice).
 2. If voice input:
 • It is sent to RealtimeSTT_Server.py for real-time transcription.
 3. The text is then sent to the Cohere AI model to generate a suitable response.
 4. The response is converted to audio using ElevenLabs.
 5. The final response is presented to the user both in text and audio.
